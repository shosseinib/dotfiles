* What is the *meta-organism* of *culture*?
* Language, *semiotics*, and defaults.
* Culture can be adapted by delusions when power is provided to psychiatric patients.
* Edward Wilson: from gene to culture:
** The part about culture in the ants' colonies is excellent.

* Why we should be spektical about ML and DL?

  * High dependency on existing data.
  * Poor generalization
  * Lack of interpretability: *=the black-box nature of most of the NNs=*
  * shortcomings of DL align with the strengths of GOFAI
  * lack of full expressive power of logic.

  * We can use both knowledge base and logic nature of GOFAI.
  * The hybrid needed only about 10 percent of the training data required by solutions based purely on deep neural networks.

  * René Descartes:
    #+begin_quote
I think tastes, odors, colors are no more than mere names so far as to an object as we locate them are concerned and that they reside in consciousness. Hence if the living creatures were removed, all these qualities would be wiped away and annihilate.

  * As Descartes says: mind is a non-physical 
  * The problem of dualism: *=The article doesn't talk about the ontology of the dualism. But here I would consider it as a greate problem. The fun aspect of facts is that if we seek an alternative to the dualism, actually we are trying to walk in the dualism line.=*
*** TODO * *=I should read at list=* =plato=: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/
  * Roger Penrose says:
    #+begin_quote
There is something(quantum mechanical) going in our brains that current day physics can’t explain.
    #+end_quote
    - This quote reminds me I should re-read his book. *=Shadows of the Mind=*.
** TODO John McCarthy, *The Philosophy of AI and the AI of philosophy*. 2006. [[[file:books/aiphil2.pdf][pdf]]]
* Write conde of conduct
** TODO Add a placeholder at the beginning
** TODO Write multiple blog post to argue multiple codes
** *Symbolic Artificial Intelligence*. (2021, December 24). [[https://innovature.ai/symbolic-artificial-intelligence/amp][innovature.ai]]
  * NNs are very powerful at certain types of learning, modeling, and action, but have *limited capability for abstraction*. 
  * in GOFAI reasoning process can be easily understood. A symbolic AI can easily explain why a certain conclusion is reached and what the reasoning steps had been.
  * NNs and ML is difficult to understand how the system concluded. It is very important when applied to critical applications such as self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, among others.
** *What is symbolic artificial intelligence?* (2019, November 17). [[https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/11/18/what-is-symbolic-artificial-intelligence/amp][bdtechtalks]]
#+begin_quote
Called expert systems, these symbolic AI models use hardcoded knowledge and rules to tackle complicated tasks such as medical diagnosis. But they require a huge amount of effort by domain experts and software engineers and only work in very narrow use cases. As soon as you generalize the problem, there will be an explosion of new rules to add (remember the cat detection problem?), which will require more human labor.

Is the *=labor work=* and *=hardcoring=* a bad thing?
