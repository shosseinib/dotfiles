\section*{Summary of the Proposal}


\section*{Background}

\lettrine{W}{hile} many problems in biology have been solved by the experiments, there are a few problems that are not addressed due to their complexity in the manner of reductionistic approach. Among these issues, the sub-cellular localization of macromolecules is one of the most challenging problems that is highly correlated with many biological conditions and states, including homeostasis, disorders, diseases, and physiological states \cite{}. According to the current wet-lab efforts, localization detection of proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates can be done by the staining and mass-based methods \cite{}. However, due to these methods' costly and time-consuming nature, high-throughput detection of the localization of macromolecules is limited experimentally. Furthermore, the isolated aspect of the cells and their organelles make the most of organic molecules compartment-specific. This specification can be determined by the physicochemical properties of the molecules and their functions in the prospective of magnifying shrinking. As the intermediate agents of the cellular and meta-cellular functionalities, the RNAs can be considered a critical factor in understanding how their subcellular localization could be effective in multiple physiological conditions. In addition, cell functions, structures, and states could be affected by their cycle stages. Multiple cell cycle stages can be passed by adjusting characteristic features of the cycle checkpoints. Expression of the multiple genes can influence the checkpoints' state and the appearance of the multiple cellular receptors and factors that could involve the intra- and inter-cellular signalings. This study investigates how we can predict the localization of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) according to their sequence, gene, and potential cell cycle-dependent expressions.

\subsection*{RNA Localizations}

Gene expression can be controlled by the spatial and local translation \cite{chouaib2020dual}. Events such as co- and post-transcriptional procedures lead to several significant results which can control the nuclear retention, or cytoplasmic export of the RNAs \cite{Garland2020Mar}. The latter is a crucial regulatory junction for both protein-coding mRNAs and lncRNAs, and cytoplasmic enrichment varies dramatically within and between those groups. For instance, many lncRNAs work in the nucleus while tethered to the chromatin, so there should be a situation to ensure their nuclear placement. mRNAs of protein-coding genes are translated in the cytoplasm, and their retention in the nucleus can regulate the amount of protein produced from each mRNA, thus allowing tight temporal regulation of translation \cite{zuckerman2019predictive}. Localization of these two types of RNA is correlated with various factors, including their sequence, splicing efficiency, c-rich hexamers, 3' and 5'-untranslated regions, secondary structures, RNA-protein interactions, pseudo-knot structures, cellular functions and types, cell cycle, co-translation with other RNAs, type of intercellular interactions, pathway involvements, their \emph{cis}-acting elements or zip codes, \emph{trans}-acting factors, RNA recognition motifs or domains, insolubility, and post-transcriptional modifications. \cite{Masamha2018Jan, Kurozumi2021Oct, zuckerman2019predictive, Gandhi2018Dec, ainger1997transport, chadi2021davi, Yergert2021Jan, suresh2015rpi, chouaib2020dual, Paschou2012Oct, Chaudhuri2020Jul, Bouvrette2019, Chin2017Nov, Bovaird2018Sep, Tejido2021Aug, Francois-Moutal2019Dec, Meyer2017Apr, Watanabe2018Nov, Markmiller2021Sep}.

Generally, Occam's razor can neither approve nor disapprove of any particular method among the divergent spatial cell division methods. Nevertheless, if we want to walk through evolution, we can divide sub-cellular spaces into the nucleus and para-nuclear. It can be performed in a chronological trajectory step-wised aspect. Following this binary division, the next step could be considered regarding the cytoplasmic compartments and organelles. The final differentiation should be the cellular surfaces and extra-cellular environments. Extra-cellular sections usually are exported by membraned structure to maintain cellular condition for regulatory and signaling functions of the RNAs \cite{}.

\subsection*{Cell Cycle}

The cell cycle is the central dogma of the normal cellular growth conception which generally comprises four major phases: growth or gap 1 phase ($G_1$), synthesis phase ($S$), growth or gap 2 phase ($G_2$), and mitosis phase ($M$)\cite{Liu2019Sep}. In the eukaryotic cells, the passing of these phases is controlled by mechanisms called cycle checkpoints \cite{Wenzel2018Jan}. The understanding cell cycle has a considerable impact on our approach against human diseases and disorders, including cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammation-related disorders, organ failures, hemopathological diseases, various inherited syndromes, and stem cell instability \cite{Esteban2020May, Wiman2017May, Wang2009Sep, Canaud2022, Tsai2014Aug, Huang2016May}. RNA subcellular localization could be associated with the cell cycle \cite{chouaib2020dual, Blackinton2014Oct}. Some studies have shown RNA partitioning help physically localize, temporally coordinate, and efficiently translate cell cycle proteins \cite{Blackinton2014Oct}.

$N^6$-methyladenosine (m$^6$A), which is near the stop codons, is one of the most well-known RNA modifications that directly influence the RNA localization \cite{Beemon1977Jun, Scholler2018Jan} and also correlate with cell cycle \cite{Horiuchi2013Nov, Yoneda2020Apr, Wu2018Oct}. Despite these observations, by now, there is no well-done study to shed light on the rational pattern of \emph{cell cycle / RNA sequence / RNA localization} triplet co-occurrence.

\subsection*{Drug Delivery}

After almost two centuries of modern drug discovery \cite{Salazar2017Jan}, it would not be a radical view if we say that the most challenging aspect of human pharmaceutical is drug delivery rather than drug discovery \cite{Mitchell2021Feb}. Today scientists have enough privileges to come across the countless number of candidate hit and lead molecules which not only can target the various biological structures such as cellular receptors, enzymes, nucleic acids, intra- and extra-cellular skeletons, and invasive organisms but also can be as the contrast elements to improve diagnosis of the patient.
These privileges include various tools,  from industrial and laboratory instruments to many computational predictors and simulators. Due to our lack of knowledge about how drugs reach their targets in the body based on their ADMET (\textbf{A}bsorption, \textbf{D}istribution, \textbf{M}etabolism, \textbf{E}limination, and \textbf{T}oxicity) pharmacokinetic properties designing the drug delivery systems has become a costly practice in the \emph{in vivo} models and clinical trials \cite{Wang2021Oct}. The recent international competition in the enterprise and academic COIVD-19 vaccine platform design league is just a small example of this field \cite{Chung2021Mar, Weintraub2020Nov}.

After one century of devoting to seeking small molecules as therapeutic agents, the idea of macromolecule usage as the active immunotherapeutics arose at the beginning of the 20$^{th}$ century \cite{Waldmann2003Mar} and has continued strongly until the day. These types of therapeutics are in the types of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), vaccines, oncolytic viruses, gene therapies, adopted cell therapies, cytokines, and immune checkpoints \cite{Anguela2019Jan, Sudhakar2019Jan, Oiseth2017Oct, Dunbar2018Jan}. In this field, the most major challenges come up with the design targeting potency and selectivity besides the preserving drugs starting from the location of the administration to the target organ, tissue, and cell \cite{Mitchell2021Feb}.

RNA targeting agents are molecules with various applications from aminoglycoside antibacterials to gene-editing CRISPR/Cas platforms \cite{Aradi2020Sep, O'Connell2019Jan}. From antivirals to the new promising method, protein isoforms \cite{Aradi2020Sep, Zhan2008Jan}.

Since RNA transcription and translation are phases- and location-dependent, finding an optimum approach to clear the mentioned triplet occurrence.

\section*{Methodology}

\subsection*{Databases and datasets}

\subsubsection*{RNALocate}

RNA (\url{http://www.rnalocate.org}) is a semi-curated comprehensive dataset providing multi-species RNA spatial localization information with the benefits of RNA-seq integration, homology, interactions, and disease-related data. This dataset collects about 40000 RNA entries among 104 species \cite{Cui2022Jan}.
\subsubsection*{Cyclebase}
Cyclobase (\url{https://cyclebase.org}) is a experimental, knowledge based, and predictions dataset including genome-wide cell-cycle-related experiments data. This database provides time-course based measurements for 13279, 6470, 491, and 21002 unique genes for human (\emph{Homo sapiens}), budding yest (\emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}), fission yeast (\emph{Schizosaccharomyces pombe}), and arabidopsis (\emph{Arabidopsis thaliana}), respectively \cite{Santos2015Jan}.

\subsubsection*{Cell Cycle Genes}

Cell Cycle Genes (\url{http://hegemon.ucsd.edu/CellCycle}) is a publicly available result of an unbiased Boolean analysis of gene expression data for cell cycle gene identification in the human, mouse, plant, and fly. The main aim of this study is the find a better insight into the synchronization-based cell-cycle genes expression \cite{Dabydeen2019Jul}. As these genes are highly correlated to cell proliferation and its stages, we will directly emphasize their expression locations and other expression criteria.

\subsubsection*{EmExplorer $^*$}

Stem cells, embryos, and oocytes are some hot topics and pop-science affairs which attract many theory thoughts and debates among people \cite{Cox2022Jan, Cavaliere2017Dec, Gruen2003Jul, Ishiguro2010Aug}. Since histology and cells differentiation starts from embryos and differentiation is a cell cycle-dependent mechanism, its gene expression could be considered as an alternative ($^*$)\cite{Liu2019Sep}.

EmExplorer (\url{http://bioinfor.imu.edu.cn/emexplorer/public/}) is a freely available dataset that collects and represents the oocyte, zygote, 2-, 4-, and 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst corresponding gene expression data \cite{Hu2019Jun}.
