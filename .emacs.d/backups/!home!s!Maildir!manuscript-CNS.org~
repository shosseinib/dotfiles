*Abstract*

Neuronal death underlies the symptoms of several human neurological
disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases,
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that their precise pathophysiology
have not yet been elucidated. According to various studies the
prohibition is the best therapy with neuroprotective approaches which
are advanced and safe methods. Lewy bodies are the histopathologic
characteristics of neurodegenerative disorders and are protein-rich
intracellular deposits in which Alpha-Synuclein is its major protein.
Alpha-Synuclein's toxic potential provides a compelling rationale for
therapeutic strategies aimed at decreasing its burden in neuronal cells
through numerous pathways including ubiquitin-proteasome system and
autophagy-lysosome Pathway, proteolytic breakdown via cathepsin D,
kallikrein-6 (neurosin) ,calpain-1 or MMP9, heat shock proteins, and
proteolysis targeting chimera which consists of a target protein ligand
and an E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3) followed by target protein
ubiquitination. Other targets that have been noticed recently are the
mutant huntingtin, tau proteins and glycogen synthase kinase 3β that
their accumulation proceeds extensive neuronal damage and up to the
minute approach such as Proteolysis Targeting Chimera promotes its
degradation in cells. As various studies demonstrated that Mendelian
gene mutations can result into the neurodegenerative diseases,
additional target that has gained much interest is epigenetics such as
mutation, phosphodiesterase, RNA binding proteins and Nuclear
respiratory factor 1. This review summarizes some of the already-known
and newly emerged neuroprotective targets that their experimental
effects has been reported.

*Introduction*

Neurodegenerative disorders, the main representatives of which are
[[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Omim/dispmim?104300][Alzheimer's
disease]] (AD) and relate
dimentia, [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Omim/dispmim?168600][Parkinson's
disease]] (PD),
[[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Omim/dispmim?105400][amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), fronto-temporal-dementia (FTD) and Huntington
lead to the defeat of functional neurons and synapses and eventually
cell death. Neurological disorders affect numerous people annually and
lead to human disability and mortality. These disorders form a vast
proportion of the total number of neurological diseases which load a
burden of very high financial cost for society. The total cost of
neurodegenerative disorders has been evaluated about 72 billion Euros
for year 2004 (1).

Various factors have been shown to take a part in etiologies of
neurodegenerative disorders such as, toxicity, metabolic disorders,
inflammation, genetic defects and etc. Despite of identification of
several signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative
disorders their exact pathophysiology have not yet been precisely
illuminated (2). In order to slow or stop the evolution of
neurodegenerative disease the administration of an etiopathogenic
treatment which interferes with the developing pathogenic process is
suggested(3). Existing treatments for most of these diseases are not
satisfactory and the best therapy is the prohibition of these
devastating disorders(3). Neuroprotective approaches are the up to the
minute methods that suggest safe and efficient prophylaxis and they work
prior to the initiation of damage(4).

Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) are the histopathologic
characteristics of neurodegenerative disorders   such as Parkinson
disease (PD), Parkinson disease with dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies
(DLB), and the mixed form of Alzheimer disease (AD) and DLB(5)(6). Since
neuronal loss is found in the propensity sites for LBs, it has been
thought to be an indicator of neuronal degeneration(7). LBD are
characterized by the aberrant accumulation and deposition of misfolded
and aggregated numbers of proteins such as alpha-synuclein (α-syn) a
main component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites(5-8). Accumulation of
aggregated insoluble α-Synuclein is a pathological hallmark of a
different neurodegenerative disorders, known as α-synucleinopathies,
including Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia, multiple system
atrophy (9,10). Thus, according to the potential toxicity of α-syn
aggregates, therapeutic approaches for synucleonopathies might involve
decreasing the levels or accumulation of intracellular and extracellular
α-syn (11). Another target that has been noticed recently is the tau
proteins expressed at very low levels in the central nervous system, and
its accumulation preceding extensive neuronal damage(12,13). Moreover,
Aggregation of mutant huntingtin (mHtt) seems to be the cause of
Huntingtin disease and removal of abnormal mHtt could be a desirable
therapeutic approach (12). Moreover, various studies illuminated the
pivotal role of genetics in neurodegenerative disorders(14--16).

In this literature we are going to review several neuroprotective
targets that their experimental effects have been reported.

1. *Alpha-synuclein*

Lewy bodies are lipid-rich and protein-rich intracellular deposits in
the cytoplasmic space of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra
pars compacta region of the brain leading to cell death, degeneration of
dopaminergic neurons, as a result, dopamine levels decrease(17,18). It
was illustrated that neuronal loss is in the close relationship with LB
which is defined by anomalous aggregation of α-syn (5-8). In general,
α-Syn monomers under physiological conditions of the body are in a
balance between a folded membrane-bound state and an unfolded soluble
state, but following misfolding or unfolding, they are found in the
structure of Lewy bodies in form of protofilaments, oligomers, and
fibrils, which can cause various toxicities(19,20). It is now well shown
that α-syn oligomers are the toxic form that may diminish essential
neuronal procedures, such as ER-Golgi trafficking, lysosome and
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS functions), reduced mitochondrial
activity and alter the plasma membrane(21).

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body
dementia and etc. are associated with insoluble  α-syn accumulation and
aggregation (9)(10). Although the mechanism of α-synuclein aggregation
is not identified(11), recent studies suggests that impairment of
lysosomal pathways (i.e. autophagy) involved in α-synuclein clearance
might play an important role(10). Moreover, some studies illustrated
that α-synuclein accumulation is caused by inhibition of
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy-lysosome pathway the two
most important mechanisms that normally repair or remove abnormal
proteins and they play an essential role in the pathogenesis of many
neurodegenerative disorders(8-11). Increasing proteolytic breakdown of
α-syn with cathepsin D, kallikrein-6 (neurosin) ,calpain-1 or MMP9; or
by promoting the binding of α-syn to chaperone-like molecules such as
Associated Membrane Protein 1(LAMP1), β-syn and HSPs are the other
approaches for raising the clearance of α-synuclein (22,23).Inhibition
of α-synuclein aggregation is an attractive pathway for drug development
which attracts several group to focus on(21). In this part we are going
to review the mechanisms and substances which involves in rising of
α-synuclein degradation.

1. *Ubiquitin-proteasome System and Autophagy-lysosome Pathway*

The ubiquitin--proteasome pathway promotes the degradation of proteins
by first catalyzing the formation of a polyubiquitin chain on the target
protein and then is recognized by the proteasome, allowing the target
protein to be degraded(24).  The autophagy--lysosome pathway (ALP) is a
primary mechanism by which damaged organelles and long‐lived proteins
are eliminated from cells and their components recycled(25). There are
three different mechanisms for lysosomal delivery of proteins:
macro-autophagy, micro-autophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy(26).
Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective degradation of
cytosolic proteins loading a targeting motif in their amino acid
sequence (KFERQ-consensus sequence-containing) recognized by a cytosolic
chaperone (hsc70) and its co-chaperones and modulate the interaction of
the substrate with a receptor for CMA (lysosome-associated membrane
protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) (27-29). The substrate unfolds and it is then
translocated across the lysosomal membrane helped by a luminal
chaperone(30). CMA is the most suitable form of autophagy owing to its
selectivity under those circumstances requiring clearance of only
particular proteins rather than bulk degradation(26). In an experiment
it was revealed that CMA is definitely involved in wild type α-synuclein
degradation in PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells, and in primary cortical and
midbrain neurons(31). It was illustrated that wild-type α-synuclein was
selectively degraded by the chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway. The
pathogenic A53T and A30P α-synuclein mutants bound to the lysosomal
membrane receptor for this pathway and acts as uptake blockers which in
turn inhibits both their own degradation and that of other
substrates(32).

Ebrahimi et al. demonstrated that under normal condition the UPS is the
main pathway for α-synuclein degradation in vivo while with increased
α-synuclein burden the ALP is recruited(33). Another experiment showed
that targeting the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), a key
controller of cellular metabolism that effects mTOR (mammalian target of
rapamycin) activation, might diminish dopaminergic neurons degeneration
in animal models of PD. In fact, it was exhibited that a modulator of
the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) called MSDC-0160 reduces
pyruvate transport into mitochondria and inhibits mTOR works which in
turn improves the autophagy in a-synuclein induced toxicity in C.
elegans(34). In a study done by
[[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40035-019-0159-7#auth-Jia_Zhen-Wu][Jia-Zhen
Wu]] et al., α-synuclein accumulation and aggregation were prohibited by
dihydromyricetin (DHM) and salvianolic acid B (Sal B) extracted from
natural medicinal plants both in in vitro and in vivo. At first, it was
observed that low doses of DHM and Sal B diminished the expression level
of α-syn aggregates by up-regulating the CMA pathway in the H4
neuroglioma cells. Then it was confirmed that DHM and Sal B up-regulate
LAMP-1, an important marker for the structure and function of lysosomal
membranes and LAMP-2A, a pivotal marker of CMA, in α-syn transgenic
mice(35).

Another experiment demonstrated that synthesized dihydroquinazoline
analogues using the multicomponent method characterize a promising 20S
activators. Among the analogues, they discovered various active
compounds and a few of the most potent 20S activators. Compounds varied
in their structure at the 7-, 2-, and 3-positions (R1, R2, and /R/3,
respectively) of the heterocyclic scaffold. Screening of the library of
dihydroquinazolines was conducted in two stages. Firstly, each compound
was evaluated at 3 concentrations (3, 10 and 30 μM) for lead compounds
selection. In the next step, lead compounds were further evaluated by
full concentration responses (ranging from 1.25-40 μM) for each of the
three proteolytic activities of the 20S proteasome and a combination
thereof. Analyzing the results showed that compounds *10*, *2* and *18*
have the highest Max-Fold activities. Although the three compounds
presented approximately the same activities and potency, compound *18*
was selected to move forward with because of its lowest overall AC200
values (the concentration at which 20S activity was doubled) and the
individual activities of the catalytic sites of the 20S. The ability of
compound *18* to improve 20S-mediated degradation of α-synuclein was
evaluated to verified its efficacy. It was identified that compound *18*
efficiently boosted the rate of degradation of α-synuclein by the 20S
/in vitro/ in a concentration dependent manner. (36).

Hebron et al. in 2013 evaluated the effects of tyrosine kinase
inhibition via nilotinib, approved by FDA in 2007 for the treatment of
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), on clearance of α-synuclein in
animal models of synucleinopathies. It was shown that autophagic removal
of α-synuclein increased in transgenic mice, and the drug also prevented
α-synuclein induced neurodegeneration in mice. They have illustrated
that nilotinib significantly diminished the levels of LC3-II
(autophagosomes amount indicator)/actin (59%) and LC3-II/LC3-I (49%)
levels, suggesting that nilotinib turns autophagic clearance on to
degrade a-synuclein. Transgenic α-synuclein mice harboring the arginine
to threonine (A53T) mutation of human α-synuclein were used as a model
of α-synucleinopathies. 7--8-month-old transgenic α-synuclein mice were
used in order to evaluate the effects of nilotinib on α-synuclein levels
in that harbor the A53T mutation of α-synuclein (37).

In a study, Höllerhage et al., illustrated that the phenothiazine
neuroleptic drug trifluperazine improves macro-autophagy and hinders the
death of human post-mitotic dopaminergic cells induced by overexpressing
α-synuclein. To monitor activation of autophagy, the conversion of
LC3B-I by phosphatidylethanolamine conjugation to LC3B-II, which is
firmly associated with autophagosomes, and the cellular content of
LC3B-II was used as a quantity for the presence of autophagosomes. In
their model, it was shown that trifluoperazine raised LC3B-II in a
concentration dependent manner. Treatment with chloroquine, which blocks
the fusion of autophagosomes, along with trifluoperazine could raise
LC3B-II levels beyond the levels seen with trifluoperazine alone. The
latter indicates that LC3B-II levels were enhanced by trifluoperazine
through stimulation of autophagosome production, rather than by blocking
their degradation. Lund human mesencephalic (LUHMES) cells were treated
with different concentrations of trifluoperazine. One day after
adenoviral transduction with wild-type alpha-synuclein and five days
later, lactate dehydrogenase release, as cell death assay, was decreased
by trifluoperazine in a concentration dependent manner in comparison to
wild-type α-synuclein overexpressing cells without treatment.
Constantly, cultures of alpha-synuclein overexpressing cells incubated
by trifluoperazine exhibited higher numbers of vital cell counts in
comparison with alpha-synuclein overexpressing cells without exposure
(38).

In another experiment, Macedo et al illuminated that
(poly)phenol-digested metabolites from /Arbutus unedo/ leaves (LPDMs)
promote the clearance of a-synuclein by restoring proteasomal and
autophagic activities in vivo. Yeast cells were incubated by 62 μg
GAE/ml of LPDMs for 6 h, in galactose medium and clearance of
a-synuclein assessed by western blot at 6 h of a-synuclein induction (0
h clearance) and after 18 h in glucose medium (18 h of clearance). After
6 h of a-synuclein induction cytometry (FCM) using GFPu (Green
fluorescent protein reporter, consisting of GFP fused with a main
degradation signal) median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was utilized for
Proteasome loss evaluation, moreover, autophagy evaluated by GFP-Atg8
(green fluorescent protein fused to Autophagy-related protein 8 )
processing assay determined by western blot , after 6 h of a-synuclein
induction(39).

Another study illustrated the capability of trehalose (at concentrations
of 5 and 2% in drinking water), as an autophagy enhancer, to protect
against A53T α-synuclein-mediated dopamine degeneration in an
adeno-associated virus serotype 1/2 (AAV1/2)-based rat model of PD. It
was confirmed that trehalose diminished AAV1/2 A53T α-synuclein induced
behavioral impairment in rats along with improvement in dopamine
neuronal survival and inhibition of α-synuclein accumulation produced by
nigral delivery of AAV1/2 A53T α-synuclein in rats and also autophagy
enhancement in striatum of AAV1/2 A53T α-synuclein-injected rats. They
observed a 3.6- and 3.8-fold raise of LC3-II in striatum after 5 and 2 %
oral administration of trehalose for 6 weeks compared with solely AAV1/2
A53T α-synuclein-challenged rats (40). Supinder Kaur and colleagues
reported that osmolytes like trehalose, xylitol, and sorbitol could be
effective in inhibiting the accumulation of α-synuclein in transgenic
/caenorhabditis elegans/ model. They have illustrated that lower
concentrations of protein stabilizers were inefficient on α-synuclein
aggregation, but a greater concentration (10 mM) presented a notable
impact on the studied phenotypes. Trehalose, at 10 mM concentration,
reduced alpha synuclein levels and reactive oxygen species, while raised
significantly in motility, dopamine levels and up-regulation of
autophagic and chaperonic
genes /bec-1/, /lgg-1/, /epg-8/, /hsp-60/ and /hsp-4/ in alpha-synuclein
expressing model. Their investigation exhibited the capability of
trehalose in improving manifestations associated with parkinsonism 
through the induction of autophagic machinery /in vivo/ (41).

2. *Heat shock proteins*

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are ubiquitous class of proteins that mediate
protein folding, remodeling and even disaggregation. They are pivotal
factors of the cellular response to various type of stress. They are
family of chaperones  responsible for promoting proper protein folding
and preventing aggregation, as well as promoting ubiquitination and
degradation of misfolded proteins(42,43). McLean et al. demonstrated
that overexpression of torsin A, family of proteins share sequence
similarities with yeast chaperone protein Hsp104, and specific heat
shock proteins decrease α‐synuclein accumulation in this cellular model,
whereas mutant torsin A has no influence. To test this hypothesis
firstly they observed four confirmed cases of DLB for the existence of
HSPs in Lewy bodies (LB) in the substantia nigra and it was demonstrated
that specific HSP molecular chaperones immunolocalize with α‐synuclein
in LB in substantia nigra. These data suggested that torsin A, Hsp40,
and Hsp70 are part of the cellular response to misfolded α‐synuclein.
Surprisingly, overexpression of torsin A, HDJ‐1, HDJ‐2, and Hsp70, but
not mutant torsin, can suppress α‐synuclein aggregation in a cell
culture model(42).

 In an experiment conducted by Klucken et al in 2004, it was illustrated
that Introducing the molecular chaperone Hsp70 into the /in vivo/ model
by alpha-synuclein transgenic mice generation via Hsp70-overexpressing
mice result to a remarkable decrease in both the high molecular weight
and detergent-insoluble alpha-synuclein species. Alongside, they
detected that Hsp70 overexpression /in vitro/ reduced
detergent-insoluble alpha-synuclein species and conserved Human H4
neuroglioma cells from alpha-synuclein-induced cytotoxicity. In this
study, fresh-frozen brain tissues (temporal cortex) from 12 subjects
with a pathological diagnosis of DLB and 8 subjects without a
neurodegenerative disease, as a control group. For in vitro model, H4
cells were passaged 24 h prior to transfection and plated in four-well
chamber slides for immunocytochemistry. The number of cells containing
α-synuclein-immunopositive inclusions was assessed by
immunocytochemistry (44).

McLean et al. investigated the effect of geldanamycin (GA), a naturally
occurring benzoquinone of ansamycin family that induces heat shock
protein 70 (Hsp70), on a cell culture model of a-synuclein aggregation.
They detected that GA induced Hsp70 expression in both a concentration-
and time-dependent manner. Remarkable Hsp70 induction was detected with
100nM GA and expression raised with increasing doses of GA up to 500nM.
H4 cells pretreatment with 200nM GA for 16--18h prior to transfection,
prevented α-synuclein aggregation by approximately 50% and protected
against toxicity while treatment with GA at the time of transfection or
12--24h post-transfection had no impact on the number of transfected
cells containing a-synuclein 24h later. In summary, they demonstrated
that GA can induce Hsp70 expression in H4 neuroglioma cells, decrease
the number of cells with a-synuclein inclusions, reduce a-synuclein
aggregation observed via Western blot, and prevent a-synuclein induced
toxicity (45).

In an experiment done by Daturpalli et al. it was examined the impact of
Hsp90 on the accumulation of the A53T mutant of α-synuclein in vitro.
They have shown while Hsp90 used at one-tenth, the concentration of A53T
α-synuclein does not influence the aggregation kinetics; when used at
near stoichiometric amounts, Hsp90 wholly diminishes the A53T
α-synuclein aggregation. They have revealed that while Hsp90 does not
interact with monomeric A53T α-synuclein and does not powerfully combine
with A53T α-synuclein fibrils, it interacts to form stable complexes
with oligomeric A53T α-synuclein. Moreover, they have also illustrated
that Hsp90 abolishes cytotoxicity induced by A53T α-synuclein in SHSY5Y
cells. The viability of SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells in the presence of
A53T α-synuclein samples was evaluated utilizing aWST-1 and calcein-AM
assay. It was shown that the cells treated with aged A53T α-synuclein,
its viability was reduced while similarly aged A53T α-synuclein samples
incubated with Hsp90 were added to the cells, cell survival was that of
untreated cells(46)/./

In 2005, it was demonstrated that GA organized stress response in order
to protect cells from neurotoxic effects of α-synuclein in /Drosophila/
Parkinson disease model. GA simplifies Hsp70 induction to larger levels
than in placebo-treated flies when they were exposed to submaximal
levels of heat stress (between 30 °C and 33 °C). In fact, the basal
levels of Hsp70 in control and α-synuclein-expressing flies are not
changed by GA, signifying that GA acts only to enhance chaperone levels
in stressed cells and does not alter chaperone activity in neighboring,
healthier cells(47).

Another experiment illustrated that a lead compound, SNX-0723
(2-fluoro-6-[(3/S/)-tetrahydrofuran-3-ylamino]-4-(3,6,6-trimethyl-4-oxo-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1/H/-indol-1-yl)benzamide),
a novel class of Hsp90 inhibitors, was determined to have an EC_{50} for
inhibition of α-syn oligomerization of approximately 48 nM and was able
to inhibit α-syn-induced toxicity. Moreover, in vivo evaluation of
SNX-0723 showed significant brain concentrations concomitantly with
induction of brain Hsp70. Low EC_{50}, good brain absorption and
excellent oral bioavailability, these novel inhibitors represent an
exciting new therapeutic strategy for PD. In this study, a novel protein
complementation assay has been used to screen a series of small-molecule
Hsp90 inhibitors for their ability to prevent α-syn oligomerization and
toxicity. (48).

Ambroxol is a small molecule chaperone that has been shown to increase
glucocerebrosidase (lysosomal enzyme) activity in vitro. In an
investigation in 2016, it was shown the effect of ambroxol treatment on
glucocerebrosidase activity and on α-synuclein and phosphorylated
α-synuclein protein levels in mice. They illustrated that ambroxol
increases glucocerebrosidase activity and decreases α-synuclein in mice
with over-expression of this protein. In this experiment Mice were
treated with ambroxol for 12 days and glucocerebrosidase activity was
measured in the mouse brain lysates. The brain lysates were also
evaluated for a-synuclein and phosphorylated a-synuclein protein levels.
(49).

3. *Proteolytic Enzymes*

Although α-synuclein is degraded by entering lysosome thorough
autophagic pathway, it is supposed that it is rapidly degraded by a
proteolytic enzyme or enzyme complex, referred to as synucleinases (50).
Kallikrein-6 (KLK6), calpain-1 (CAPN1) and cathepsins are a small number
of proteases which have been identified as intracellular and
extracellular α-synuclein cleavage enzymes(23). Cathepsins are the major
class of lysosomal proteases and classified according to the active-site
amino acids that confer catalytic activity. These are cysteine, serine,
and aspartyl cathepsins (51).

Cathepsin D (CathD or CtsD) is a major lysosomal aspartate  proteases
composed of two disulfide-linked polypeptide chains, both produced from
a single protein precursor(50). An experiment conducted by Cullen et al.
showed that cathepsin D can effectively degrade excess α-synuclein in
dopaminergic cells. In order to investigate whether CathD has any effect
on a-syn turnover, they used a rodent cell line of mesencephalic origin.
They first examined the ability of CathD to regulate both wild-type and
mutant α-synuclein a dopaminergic cell culture system which the results
indicate that CathD increases degradation of both wild-type and mutant
α-synuclein proteins, and absence or deficiency of CathD can lead to
α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity /in vivo/. To figure out the role
of CathD on endogenous α-synuclein metabolism /in vivo/, a well
characterized CtsD knock-out mouse model was utilized(28). An experiment
in 2008 demonstrated that overexpression of CathD protects neurons from
α-synuclein accumulation in both mammalian cells and in /Caenorhabditis
elegans/. Reduced enzymatic activity in mutated CathD or overexpression
of cathepsins B (CB) or L (CL) does not have any neuroprotective effect
in the worm model, indicating a unique requirement for enzymatically
active CD which may inhibit or reverse LB disease-associated
neuropathology(52).

In an experiment conducted on purified mouse brain and liver lysosomal
extracts and individual human cathepsins, it was illustrated a direct
involvement of cysteine cathepsin B (CtsB) and L (CtsL) which both of
them cleave α-syn within its amyloid region and avoiding fibril
formation. In contrast, CathD considered to be a responsible for
lysosomal degradation of α-synuclein, requires the presence of anionic
lipids to degrade that same region. (53). Five years later, McGlinchey &
Lee et al, reported that CtsK is a more effective protease for degrading
α-synuclein amyloids. CtsK is capable of destroying the internal regions
after both N- and C-termini's removal, indicating protective ability of
the amyloid core from proteolytic damage. Critical cleavage sites
involved in destabilizing fibril structure are observed by peptide
mapping through liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Firstly,
in order to evaluate individual cathepsin activities, preformed a-syn
fibrils (60 mM) were incubated with CtsK, CtsB, CtsF, CtsL, CtsS, CtsV,
CtsD, CtsE, CtsA, and CtsG (150 nM) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. It was
investigated that CtsF and CtsA had no effect and CtsB, CtsS, CtsV,
CtsD, CtsE, and CtsG created lower molecular weight fragments,
equivalent to their limited proteolysis. On the contrary, CtsL and CtsK
treatments of fibrils resulted in thorough degradation and to determine
which is more effective, time course comparisons of CtsL and CtsK
activities on soluble and fibrillar α-synuclein were carried out and In
both cases, CtsK was greater(51).

Neurosin, also known as human kallikrein 6, KLK6, Zyme and Protease M,
is a serine protease capable of cleaving α-synuclein which is found to
be expressed throughout the body in several tissues such as
CNS(54,55). In an investigation, Tatebe et al. examined the localization
of neurosin and its enzyme activity using cultured HEK293T cells. It was
shown that although extracellular neurosin
had [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/proteinase][protease
activity]], intracellular neurosin did not. Moreover, it was found out
that neurosin was released from the cells, activated in the
extracellular space, and degraded extracellular α-synuclein which means
that neurosin targets the extracellular α-synuclein(56).

In a study conducted by Spencer et al. it was investigated that
administration of a modified, systemically kallikrein 6 to a mouse model
of multiple system atrophy (MBP-α-syn) model lead to accumulation of
neurosin-apoB (neurosin contains a brain-targeting sequence) in the CNS
which in turn result to reduction of α-synuclein accumulation in
oligodendrocytes and astrocytes and enhanced myelin sheath formation in
the corpus callosum and behavioral improvements (57).

In another study, it was shown that levels of neurosin are diminished in
the brains of patients with DLB and in α-synuclein transgenic (tg) mice.
For this purpose, they engineered a lentiviral vector (LV) expressing
neurosin and stereotactically delivered this to the α-syn to mouse. Four
weeks later, a reduction of α-synuclein accumulation and amelioration of
the neurodegenerative pathology were observed. Specifically, LV-neurosin
in neuronal cell cultures reduced the accumulation of wild type but not
A53T α-syn and prevented α-syn associated toxicity(58).

In a study conducted in 2003 it was clarified that the serine protease
neurosin degrades alpha-synuclein /in vitro/ and /in vivo/ and also
accumulates in inclusions such as Lewy bodies and glial cytoplasmic
inclusions. It was shown that in HEK-293 cell lysates neurosin
prohibited alpha-synuclein polymerization by reducing the amount of
monomer and also by generating fragmented alpha-synuclein which in turn
themselves prohibited the polymerization. Neurosin was discharged from
mitochondria to the cytosol, which lead to the boost of alpha-synuclein
species degradation. Down-regulation of neurosin caused accumulation of
alpha-synuclein within cultured cells. (55).

Ximerakis et al. showed that while endogenously secreted α-synuclein
cannot be proteolysis by KLK6, KLK6 is able to cleave the recombinant
α-synuclein (wt and A53T mutant) efficiently. In fact, their experiments
demonstrated that KLK6 could reduce the naturally secreted α-synuclein
directly and indirectly by metalloproteases (MMPs) (59). In another
study they also showed that proMMP2 is activated by KLK6 to cleave the
α-synuclein. Moreover, ADAMTS19 was recognized as another protease that
may be activated by KLK6 and could be part of the cascade by utilizing
TAILS (Terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates). TAILS also
showed that KLK6 recognizes a few number of protein substrates
indicating that KLK6 exhibits a little restricted substrate specificity
thus it may exert specific regulatory roles that likely include the
cleavage of α-synuclein(60).

Perni et al. reported an inhibitory effect of squalamine, an
antimicrobial agent derived from the dogfish shark, on α-synuclein
aggregation in vitro and toxicity in vivo, via displacing α-synuclein
from phospholipid membrane. They exposed a neuroblastoma cell line with
recombinant α-synuclein oligomers and determined that squalamine
diminished mitochondrial damage along with a reduction in α-synuclein
oligomer binding to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Moreover,
the authors found an improvement in motility of
α-synuclein-YFP--overexpressing worms and a reduction in α-synuclein
inclusion formation in aged worms upon administration of squalamine. In
fact, they suggest that squalamine has a specific effect against
α-synuclein accumulation, and also recommend a model where squalamine
and toxic α-synuclein oligomers compete for binding sites at the surface
of vesicles and neurons. (61).

Davis et al. exhibited the protective effect of ubiquitin ligase Nedd4
against α-synuclein-induced toxicity in two animal models of PD. In
Drosophila, it was illustrated that overexpression of Nedd4 results into
preventing toxicity of high levels of ectopically expressed wild-type
human α-synuclein in the eye or the nervous system while reduction in
endogenous Nedd4 by RNAi led to worsening motor function and enhanced
loss of dopaminergic neurons. In the rat substantial nigari they found
that expression of wild-type but not inactive Nedd4 diminished the
α-synuclein-induced dopaminergic cell loss and reduced α-synuclein
accumulation (62).

4. *PROTAC*

Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) is a two-headed molecule that
consists of a target protein ligand and an E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3)
recruiting ligand connected by a linker. Target protein degradation will
be initiate by constitution of ternary complex that consist of PROTAC,
Target protein and E3 ubiquitin ligase followed by Target protein
ubiquitination (63). It is expected that over 600 E3s exist according to
human genome but still small number of them such as Von-Hippel-Lindau
(VHL), cereblon (CRBN), murine double minute 2 (MDM2), and cell
inhibitor of apoptosis protein (cIAP)  that have small molecule ligands
used in PROTAC design and development (64).

Because of better absorption, more stability and lower molecular weight,
small molecule PROTACs have more chance than peptide PROTACs to be a
successful drug. The design of small molecule-based E3 recruiting
ligands was an important progress in PROTACs development that occurred
in 2008 by Crews et al. They developed the first small molecule PROTAC
that consist of androgen receptor ligand and nutlin the known MDM2 E3
ligand to lead the proteasomal degradation of androgen receptor (65).

alpha-synucleinopathies and neurodegenerative diseases associated with
α-syn accumulation and aggregation (AD, PD, dementia, etc.) could be
treated or prevented by use of PROTACs (Table 1). In an experiment
Kargbo et al designed six small hybrid molecules that demonstrated
α-synuclein degradation in-vitro (66).

Table 1. PROTAC structures for α-synuclein.

5. *Others*

Various studies have suggested different methods for α-synuclein
disaggregation or stabilizers. As stated, the α-syn oligomer is composed
of 140 amino acids, which according to previous studies region 71-82 is
responsible for aggregation, so different molecules such as N-methylated
peptides and non-modified peptides have been designed to this part (67).
There are other studies that have targeted other areas of the α-syn
structure. Harish Cheruvara et al. stated that most onset mutations are
between residues 46-53 and have designed 209,952 member libraries based
on this area, that the PCA derived 45-54W sequence has the ability to
prevent of α-syn aggregation (17).

In a study conducted by Hoda Eskandari et al., They used a ThT method to
find a substance that could inhibit α-syn accumulation and the formation
of toxic oligomers in /Rosa damascena/. The results showed that gallic
acid, quercetin and kaempferol could prevent aggregation and
oligomerization(68)

A study conducted in 2017 showed that Keap1 is capable of Nrf2 (The
transcription factor which targets cellular defence genes) amelioration
and protection against neuronal impairment in AD. They confirmed for the
first time that naturally-derived Aβ42 peptide-induced synapto-toxicity
can be preserved by direct inhibition of Keap1, a negative regulator of
Nrf2 in primary mouse neuronal cultures. (69).

In another study done by Siracusa et al, it was revealed that
temsirolimus treatment significantly ameliorated the upregulation of
α-synuclein in the substantia nigra after
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced (MPTP) induction in
a mice model of PD. In order to show the capability of temsirolimus to
prevent α-synuclein-induced degeneration, they evaluated the expression
of α-synuclein by Western blot in the cytosolic fraction. Eight days
after MPTP injection a major increase of α-synuclein expression was
observed, while the treatment with temsirolimus extremely reduced levels
of α-synuclein(70).

Yanqin Liu and colleagues for Inhibits α-synuclein and amyloid-β fibril
and inhibition of disease-associated protein aggregation, namely, Aβ (Aβ
1−40 and Aβ 1−42) and α-synuclein (mutant disease A53T) used
C-phycocyanin, which is a major phycobiliprotein derived from blue-green
algae (Spirulina sp.). It is commonly used in food products due to its
various hepatoprotective, antioxidant, neuroprotective and antioxidant
properties. This study showed that C-phycocyanin effectively inhibited
A53Tα-synuclein and Aβ40 / 42 fibril formation. C-phycocyanin can also
prevent primary nucleus formation and α-synuclein fibrillation, but it
has been shown that despite its extensive anti-amyloidogenic activity,
it cannot inhibit amorphous form accumulation(71).

Curcumin is another plant-derived component that has the ability to bind
to monomers and oligomers and can inhibit α-synuclein accumulation and
oligomer formation, but due to instability in the gastrointestinal tract
and insolubility in water, cannot be used effectively to prevent
Parkinson's disease(72--74).

2. *Epigenetics*

 The source of all neurodegenerative disorders is associated with
genetics, which among them AD, PD and ALS has been appraised to be
60--80% (14,15), ∼40% (75), and ∼60% (16) heredity, respectively. It was
demonstrated that Mendelian gene mutations can result into the
neurodegenerative diseases, including β-amyloid precursor protein(APP)
and presenilin genes (PSEN1, PSEN2) cause AD, α-synuclein (SNCA), Parkin
(PARK2), PTEN-induced putative kinase I (PINK1), microtubule-associated
protein tau (MAPT) and leucine-rich repeat kinase two or dardarin
(LRRK2) lead to PD, cytosolic Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), alsin
(ALS2), senataxin (SETX) and synaptobrevin/VAMP (vesicle-associated
membrane protein)-associated protein B (VAPB) for ALS (76,77), and
hexanucleotide  repeat expansion in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72
(C9ORF72) as a shared genetic leads to ALS and FTD (78) which has been
analyzed recently by CRISPR-Cas9 screens (79).

Early-onset forms of AD (EO-FAD) is mostly as a result of rare and
comprehensive mutations in three different genes (14,77). The
identification of scarce causal mutations in the three EO-FAD genes can
lead to defining the etiology of AD. In a study performed by Jungsu Kim
et al. two rare pathogenic mutations in ADAM10 that damage ADAM10 enzyme
activity and contribute to AD by 70 years old were identified (80).

The hypothesis that the gene is associated with the β-amyloid
production, which makes up senile plaques were predicted by Glenner and
Wong (1984) for the first time. They suggested that the gene related to
deposits of amyloid from cerebral blood vessel would be on chromosome 21
and carry mutations causing AD (81).

In order to identify more EO-FAD genes, the pathogenic mutations in
three other genes, apart from APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 have been detected.
It was reported that a mutation (R406W) in the tau gene (MAPT) on
chromosome 17q was tightly linked to AD in a Belgian family (82,83). In
another experiment it was illustrated that EO-FAD in a Dutch family was
associated with chromosome 7q36 next to the PAX transcription activation
domain interacting protein gene (PAXIP1) (84). Moreover, it was reported
that in an AD family the gene for PEN2 on chromosome 19, encoding the
γ-secretase component which generates β-amyloid, was harbor a missense
mutation, D90N (85).

The most common form of the AD is the Late-onset Alzheimer's (LOAD)
characterized by onset age >65 years and despite of EO-FAD, it is a
genetically complex pattern of inheritance in which genetic risk
factors, environmental factors and life exposure events accompany to
regulate lifetime risk for AD. Consequently, this in turn makes it
difficult to detect novel LOAD position, mainly because a mixture of
replications and refutations often plagues efforts at replication (86).
Thus far, the apolipoprotein E gene with 14 allele on chromosome 19q13
is the only gene variant considered an established LOAD risk factor
(87). Genetic relationship of LOAD to chromosome 19 in the proximity of
APOE which binds Aβ in cerebrospinal fluid leads to identification of
APOE as an AD gene. Consecutively, according to APOE genomic location
and its function, it can be represented as a feasible candidate gene for
AD. The three significant alleles of APOE encode three different
isoforms which differ by single amino acid substitution at positions 112
and 158: E3 (Cys 112, Arg 158), E4 (Cys112Arg) and E2 (Arg158Cys). The
allele E4 of APOE enhances AD risk by approximately four-fold when
inherited in one copy and more significant than 10-fold for two allele
doses. On the contrary, the E2 allele of APOE shows protective effects
(88).

As concurrent probability development of PD and AD is much greater than
would happen by random chance, making them a major candidate for the
investigation of overlapping gene signatures which was the goal in a
comparative study marking three brain regions includes hippocampus,
gyrus-frontalis-medius, and cerebellum. In this investigation it was
revealed that across all three brain regions 12 genes were similarly
disturbed by PD and AD, including synaptic vesicle genes (SYT1),
Alzheimer's-related genes (APP, SNX2), insulin genes (IRS4), and
oxidative stress genes (GSTM1). Along with this, it was illustrated that
in these two disorders four genes (CNR2, HIST1H3E, CHRNA6, and BACE1)
have completely reversed regulation patterns. As an example, while
BACE1, engaged in processing Amyloid precursor protein, was
downregulated in AD, it was upregulated in PD (89).

Although majority of cases are sporadic, investigate of the genetic
basis of ALS is a successful method to distinguish its root (90). Frank
mutations occur in minority cases of ALS, however, some of the more
common variants cause high percentages of cases. interestingly, the
actual appearance of disease can be a little different even in single
families with the same mutation. ALS and FTD (frontotemporal
degeneration which is the common manifestation of the disease owing to
wide atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes of the cerebral cortex)
are associated with hexanucleotide expansion in the first intron of the
c9orf72 gene. In the line with these investigations, it was realized
that ALS-FTD implies a clinic-pathological spectrum of disease,
additionally, it demonstrated that underlying complexity of searching
for the cause of diseases such as ALS is due to the fact families with
such mixed phenotypes may not have been believed to have some concealed
disease (91--93).

According to the evidence a vital mediator of familial ALS-FTD
pathogenesis is a post-transcriptional control of gene expression by RNA
binding proteins while FTD-ALS are associated with numerous genes, a
significant subgroup is RNA binding proteins which mutations infused in
TAR-binding protein (TARDBP) (94,95), fused in sarcoma (FUS) (96,97),
and Matrin-3 (MATR3) (98), all lead to ALS, and all three proteins
production have domain structures consistent with RNA binding activity.
Surprisingly, in both FTD and ALS deposition of the protein product of
TARDBP, TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43) had been
recognized before mutations being reported (99), thus the genetic link
between these two diseases is anticipated. Although TDP-43 is usually a
nuclear protein, in ALS-FTD cases it is relocated to the cytosol of
vulnerable neuronal types. In sporadic ALS-FTD the cytosolic TDP-43 is
accumulated which suggests a further link between familial and
idiopathic forms of these diseases(99).

Iguchi et al. exhibited that deletion of TDP-43 in postnatal motor
neurons in mice model results in developed an age-dependent progressive
motor impairment ALS-like phenotypes, suggesting that loss of nuclear
function of TDP-43 plays a contributor role in ALS process (100).

It has been exhibited that FUS and TDP43 bind directly to a series of
RNA targets. TDP-43 binds to various RNA targets such as microRNA
(miRNA) in various cell and tissue types which work together with other
proteins (100--105). Although there is a quite miniature overlap between
different studies of TDP-43 bound RNA or miRNA targets, an exact set of
RNAs has been confirmed across studies, such as TDP-43 itself (106).

Matrin-3 also attaches to various other RNA binding proteins, and
sequencing has diagnosed a series of RNA targets bound to these protein
complexes. Conversely, Matrin-3 can be isolated from pulldowns of other
RNA binding proteins and co-purifies with retina-expressed small RNAs.
Finally, like TDP-43, Matrin-3 interacts physically with PTB1, a
polypyrimidine binding protein, with which it binds motifs within RNA
targets (107--110).

Moreover, it was identified that splicing of exon 9 of the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane receptor (CFTR) gene is controlled by TDP-43
(111). Besides, connecting of the 30-UTR region is controlled by TDP-43
binding to its mRNA which in turn influence its own mRNA stability
post-transcriptionally. This suggests that TDP-43 plays a pivotal role
in RNA splicing (112,113).

On the other hand, FUS is involved in pre-mRNA splicing by interactions
with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes and links these
to translation via interaction with RNA-polymerase II (110,114,115).

In general, the evidence proposes that the normal functions of TDP-43
are related to the toxicity triggered by mutations responsible for
ALS-FTD. Owing to manifold RNA targets that TDP-43 has, these
considerations suggest that mutations will lead to a comprehensive
influence on post-translational gene regulation. Equally, mutations in
FUS need RNA binding in order to exert lethal effects and result in
global deregulation of RNA metabolism which can be alleviated by the
expression of a master regulator of nonsense-mediated decay (116,117).

Progressive disorder fragile X, a common cause of psychological
impairment with additional characteristic including autistic-like
behaviors is caused by mutations in the FRM1 (fragile X mental
retardation1) gene (118). Consecutively, in fragile X syndrome the
redundant translation of RNA to protein result into a neurodevelopmental
disorder. The heavily methylated triplet repeat expansion in the 50
untranslated regions of a gene on chromosome X that the FMRP protein is
encoded is the most common underlying mutation (119). This gene
modification leads to loss of FMRP function specially in males. In
discussion, FMRP has manifold recognizable RNA binding domain (120) and
attaches a variety of mature RNA species to inhibit translation (121).

ATXN2 gene is another example that the triplet repeat expansion is found
which produce a protein with abundant repeated glutamates or polyQ that
in turn alters its normal function and leads to spinocerebellar ataxia,
an adult-onset neurological disorder with significant loss of gait and
balance (122). ATXN2 interacts with a series of other RNA binding
proteins and engages in various aspects of post-transcriptional RNA
metabolism, such as translation at polysomes and disruption of cytosolic
structures containing RNA, stress granules, or P-bodies that may promote
alteration of protein translation as these structures usually are
translationally silent (123,124).

Dopamine is essential for the regulation of psychomotor functions. The
cAMP/PKA pathway is vital for dopamine neurotransmission (125). In
neuronal signaling a cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) is
pivotal target for cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP. Serine 133
(Ser133) region is essential for CREB activation, where multiple kinases
can attach, including protein kinase A (PKA) and mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) (126,127).

cAMP and PKA have been suggested to have a role in the etiology of
neurofibrillary tangles through phosphorylation of tau (128,129).
Besides it is suggested that along with the cAMP/PKA pathway, the
NO/cGMP pathway is also play a pivotal role in memory processes and
altered in aged brains. Therefore, in the study conducted by
Domek-Łopacińska & Strosznajder, cGMP is suggested to be associated with
AD (130).

It was shown that the cAMP plays a crucial role in regulatory
T-cell-mediated suppression (131). It is also known that inflammatory
cellular responses are diminished by increasing cAMP levels (132,133).

As cAMP signaling and cGMP signaling have been in charge of
neuroplasticity, recently they has become a target for neurodegenerative
disorders by impacting their levels in the cell via PDEs inhibition
(134). The PDE superfamily based on their sequence homology consists of
11 subtypes (PDE1--PDE11) coded by 21 identified genes. In addition,
each gene product may have multiple splice variants (e.g.,
PDE4D1--PDE4D9), which add up to a total of more than 100 different PDE
proteins(135).

A number of studies have shown changes in expression of PDE in the brain
are in correlated with Alzheimer's disease. More specifically, increase
in the expression of PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE7A observed in early stages of
AD while in the severest stage PDE8B expression will be raised(136,137).
It was shown that in multiple sclerosis and depression the expression of
various subtypes of PDE altered in the central nervous system(137--139).
In autosomal-dominant striatal degeneration like PD and HD, genetic
mutation in the PDE8B gene are considered to be responsible (140).

Several studies have illustrated that the expression of cAMP-specific
PDEs mRNAs changed in AD brains(136,141). McLachlan et al. examined the
expression of isoforms of PDE4D, which has been suggested to be
essential for cognition in the hippocampus of a patient with AD. They
have shown that despite of a reduction in the expression of most
isoforms of PDE4D (PDE4D 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), the predominant short
form of PDE4D in the human brain, PDE4D1, was extremely raised (142).

A study performed in 2010 was reported that mRNA expression in
peripheral blood lymphocytes of several cAMP-targeting PDE subfamilies,
PDE2, 3, 4, and 7, raised in patients with MS (138). However, the levels
of expression in the brain itself are unknown. Taken together, it is
suggested that cAMP signaling has an essential role in
neuro-inflammatory processes, possibly originating from changes in PDE
levels (134).

PDE1B1 is dual-substrate (PDE Ca^{+2}/Calmodulin- dependent) isoform, is
expressed in a similar localization pattern as PDE1A1, with the highest
levels in caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens (143,144).

Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) acts as a transcription factor which
becomes embroiled in the expression of pivotal nuclear genes, in turn
engaged in mitochondrial biogenesis and function, such as mitochondrial
respiratory complex subunits, heme biosynthetic enzymes, and regulatory
factors of replication and transcription of mitochondrial DNA. Manifold
evidence designates that aging-related neurodegenerative disorders
prejudice mitochondrial function in the brains. In order to detect the
inclusive human NRF1 target genes, responsible for the pathogenesis of
neurodegenerative diseases, Satoh et al. assessed the NRF1 chromatin
immunoprecipitation accompanied by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) dataset
recovered from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project. In
this experiment performed in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells, 2,470
severe ChIP-Seq peaks which were concentrated in the proximal promoter
sections with an existence of the NRF1-binding consensus sequence were
identified on protein-coding genes. The set of ChIP-Seq-based NRF1
target genes included known NRF1 targets such as EIF2S1, EIF2S2, CYCS,
FMR1, FXR2, E2F6, CD47, and TOMM34. Moreover, it was illustrated that
the molecules relevant to the mitochondrial respiratory function are
extremely abundant in NRF1 target genes. In addition, they have
exhibited that NRF1 target genes plays essential role in RNA metabolism,
splicing, cell cycle, DNA damage repair, protein translation initiation,
and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. A panel of neurodegenerative
disorder-related genes, including PARK2 (Parkin), PARK6 (Pink1), PARK7
(DJ-1), and PAELR (GPR37) for Parkinson's disease, along with PSENEN
(Pen2) and MAPT (tau) for Alzheimer's disease, were identified.
According to the results it can be suggested that abnormal regulation of
NRF1 and targets by eruption of various mitochondrial and
extra-mitochondrial functions can lead to the pathogenesis of human
neurodegenerative disorders (145).

3. *Other Targets*

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that
aggregation of mutant huntingtin (mHtt) seems to be the cause of disease
and removal of aberrant mHtt could be a desirable therapeutic approach.
Tomoshige designed two hybrid small molecules by linking an ubiquitin
ligase ligand with a warhead for mHtt aggregates that reduced mHtt
levels in HD patient fibroblasts by induction of degradation via
ubiquitin‐proteasome system(12).

The tau proteins are expressed at very low levels in the central nervous
system, and its accumulation preceding extensive neuronal damage. In an
experiment Kargbo et al. designed small molecule PROTACs (Table 2) that
consist of tau binding moiety with an E3 ubiquitin ligase binding moiety
such as lenalidomide or thalidomide, which provide compounds to
ubiquitination of tau protein and promote its degradation in cells.
Since aggregation of tau protein causes tauopathies such as AD, a single
two-headed molecule can promote the degradation of tau protein and
introduce new compounds for the treatment of neurological disease such
as AD (146).

In a research, Silva et al. synthesized the bifunctional molecule
QC-01--175 to trigger tau ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
QC-01--175 increased the clearance of tau in frontotemporal dementia
(FTD) patient-derived neuronal cell models, with negligible effect on
tau from healthy neurons, denoting specificity for disease-relevant
forms (147).

Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) is involved in some
neurodegenerative diseases. In a study conducted by Jiang et al. series
of heterobifunctional small molecule proteolysis targeting chimera
(PROTAC) were designed and synthesized to induce ubiquitin‐proteasome
system. Most of PROTACs displayed acceptable inhibitory activity and
moderate protein degradation ability against GSK-3β. also data showed
compound PG21 had the best inhibitory activity and can effectively
degrade GSK-3β (148).

*Conclusion*

There are manifold available drugs for neurodegenerative disorders such
as AD, PD, HD which provide temporary symptomatic relief and cannot
counter the disease progression. Thus, the neurotherapeutic agents which
can not only prohibit the disease progression but can also cure the loss
of neurogenic potential of the brain are needed. Several targets
involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders discussed
here which their modulation may be an appropriate approach against the
neurodegenerative disorders are summarized in Table 3 which have great
importance in neurologic disorders or progression.
